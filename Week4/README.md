Week4 Workflow

Joe:Create a code that outputs point clouds of shapes (gaussian (normal), circle, cylinder, torus) in any chosen dimension and analyzes their ECC via Vietoris–Rips filtrations. Code also visualizes the results simultaneously as a point cloud, persistence diagram, and Euler characteristic curve.

Sergio: Pairwise distances of points as dimension increases. Trying with different shapes.
