If two points are not neighbors, what is going on?
how to avoid storing all the simplices at once but still building from 0-simplices?
really understand what's going on...
try running in parallel? (what are the two gpus doing?? (if they are working at the same time))
maybe we can only store neighbors once? since you already know
all neigbor sets are stored?
neighbor set of every xi should give all the information without any more calculation
get more clear on how the points are ordered so we don't double count
take intersection of two neighbor sets to add triangle and so on
once at list of edges how do i count all the triangles. which edge do i start and how do i count edge neighbors with edges who are not the same triangle twice? (or three times)
why can i use several gpus simultaneously?
inclusion-exclusion on the neighbor sets?

goals next week:

deeper line by line understanding of what exactly dlotko algorithms are doing
sample from [0,1] and fix 3 values of epsilon (n=50), find EC(eps1) EC(eps2) EC(eps3) repeat the sampling N times. output is summary of ECs for epsilons (mean should be around 1). we now have N EC(eps1), N EC(eps2) N EC(eps3). Then sample from Beta(alpha,Beta)

long term: 

goal is to run a simulation of collections of randomly sampled point clouds of one shape and have a collection of ECCs (simulate the distribution of ECCs) (ECCs are not full curves maybe 3 points)
    so at the end have distribution at fixed epsilon of the EC
    beta distribution??
