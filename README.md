Understanding geometry and topology are of utmost importance when developing methodology for the analysis of complex data, either high-dimensional or non-Euclidean. One important notion in this context is the so-called Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic can be defined based on observed data, and in this case it becomes a (random) quantity, describing geometric and topological features of the data cloud. This has successfully been used in machine learning and data analysis for feature extraction and other tasks. In this project we will develop a deeper understanding of the Euler characteristic, simulate the distribution of the Euler characteristic, and investigate a statistical goodness-of-fit test based on the Euler characteristic transform.
